### 1. Self-Reflection and Exploration

* **Reflective Questions**: Engage in self-reflection by asking yourself questions like "What activities make me lose track of time?" or "What subjects or topics am I naturally drawn to?" Delve into your past experiences, hobbies, and curiosities to identify patterns and potential areas of interest.
